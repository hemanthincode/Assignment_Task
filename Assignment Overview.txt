Assignment Overview

In this assignment, the task is to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques by performing a face-swapping operation using a diffusion model, specifically the Stable Diffusion model. The goal is to seamlessly integrate a face from a source image into a target image, ensuring that the final output looks natural and realistic.

Key Objectives:
- Image Extraction: Extract images from a provided PDF file using PyMuPDF.
- Face Detection and Alignment: Detect faces in both the source and target images using Haar      Cascades, and align them for the swapping process.
- Face Swapping with Stable Diffusion: Utilize the Stable Diffusion model to replace the face in the target image with the face from the source image.
- Post-Processing: Apply techniques like blending and color correction to ensure the face integrates seamlessly into the target image.
- Documentation: Provide clear and detailed documentation of the process, including code explanations, challenges faced, and the final results.

Outcome:
The final deliverable should include the swapped face integrated into the target image, with all relevant code, explanations, and documentation needed to understand and replicate the approach.
